# TestTOPLANT
Test Java file toplant.java

select concept statement text file -- uml.txt
and it should output plant class file

jar files are included add them to buildpath
there is a link the in import section how i added the Stanford tagger.

This uses a "dumb" natural language parser
All it does is looks for a noun, verb , then next noun. No real smarts going on.
Stores those three and in a table.

Once finished it prints the table our in plantUML format
Then the plant text file is made into a PNG file.

Just wanted to figure out plant output.
